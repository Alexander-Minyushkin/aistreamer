I urge you to write a novel - stories are great and certainly you can continue to write of the ongoing adventure but if this was fleshed out with some of what you could not elaborate on in this and explain the start in more detail, I could absolutely see this being a novel that would sell.

I suspect that the Oddkids had a substance or something similar that attracts bugs to them. The bugs are probably there for physical movement. I'm actually surprised your house isn't infested. If bugs are so eager to be close to you as you described your house should be swarming with creepy crawlies.

"Yes, postpartum psychosis can be terrifying. I've never had anyone in my life experience it, but I watched a documentary years ago in parenting class. It was horrible."
"Yeah. Postpartum psychosis is horrifying. Regular postpartum depression is also awful. You just aren't in your right mind, and you don't even realize it. In my case, I spent literally hours every day researching SIDS on PubMed out of sheer terror that my baby was going to die. I thought I was being totally reasonable. I also went through the very common desire to give her back to the hospital. I ended up pulling out of it after a few weeks, and my baby is the love of my life, but it was scary. 

Postpartum mood disturbances are very treatable, though. It is just important to catch them as soon as possible. If a new mother you love seems ""off"", please get her to seek help. "

"&gt; Of course I jumped to my feet, Jessica following close behind as I rushed down the stairs.

A few lines later...

&gt; ""The thing is, though, I couldn't let anyone but you see me or have any contact with me.""

If she knew no one was supposed to see her, why did she follow you when you went to go find someone in your house?  "
And the fact she didn't warn OP in the first place so he could take extra precautions.
In the fear she probably forgot momentarily...
Or it was a dubious plot to trick her into making him die sooner :-( 
How was there always food in the pantry if she couldn't go out shopping?  
My best guess is that death was helping out behind the scenes to get OP back on track to his normal life-span. 
"&gt; How was there always food in the pantry if she couldn't go out 
&gt; shopping? 

He had a breakdown. The food (like the cooking and her actions) was never real. He was probably starving. In fact, the 'robber' was probably a policeman or friend or family member or something. He brought Jessica's corpse down with him, which is what scared the other guy. His reaction was what spurred him to see the corpse right in front of himself while still imagining the conversations and actions she'd taken. 



Edit: in addition, I don't believe that he spent all of that time apart from her. I think he hallucinated or dreamed that as well. Notice how he emphasized the time at the beginning - who is he trying to convince? Himself or the audience? Notice that no life changes took place in that time period (moving, new relationships, etc). What this story is really about is his absolute and utter mental breakdown and inability to cope with loss. Hell, he may have been the one who killed her. Notice he said he has ""a drunk driver to thank for that."" Perhaps he was the drunk driver and couldn't deal with what he had done. The timeline for this story was much shorter than he described/perceived. "
Death is quite the gentleman
"As hard as it is, try not to be too afraid. These things eat off of your fear. Work together.

"Hello, I am an Arab muslim, and I can say with utmost certainty that you're only partly correct. Yes, Jinn are basically ""people"", but no, they are not in another world, they are with us, everywhere, at any given moment, they just refrain from interaction.

But Jinn also translates quite literally into 'demons' because that's what they are, demons, it's just that they are more tame in this part of the world. According to the Quran, Jinn used to serve Allah alongside Angels, all that changed when Adam was created to Rule (read 'inherit') the earth as Allah created it for the angels but they did not want it, but Iblis (name of the devil) wanted it, alongside a lot of the Jinn, to quote from the Quran ((And [mention] when We said to the angels, ""Prostrate before Adam""; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.)) 2:34, Al-Baqarah.

That was why they became bad as they were more loyal to one of their own (Iblis) rather than their creator. But what made them tame? Well they can think, and have opinions, so not all of them were loyal to the devil, but they were all banished to earth alongside him.

But part of their curse was that they were not allowed to interact with life on earth (especially humans), but to this day they partly interact with animals all over the world, either by frightening them or soothing them, just not physically interacting. Allah also forbid them from showing themselves to humans, for there would be a huge punishment for doing so.

On a side note because I see this as interesting. There was a human that could see Jinn, he was a prophet called Ø³Ù„ÙŠÙ…Ø§Ù† (solomon, known as Jedidiah in the Bible), he existed long before Jesus or Mohammed, like other prophets, he was given a gift, his being was vision of and ability to speak to all creatures, he had an army comprised of Humans, Jinn, Animals, and other creatures.

Through either living alongside humans, solomon, and being around the rise of Islam. According to the Quran, lots of Jinn became Muslims, and therefore, more tame (see the sorah: Al-Jinn). That's why they seem to be more tame around the middle east, because they are people, with consciousness, and rational thinking, while in other parts of the world, they might be going wild just to spite us, but take this with a grain of salt, most of what I know about Jinn comes from the Quran."
"Holy shit. As someone who also suffers from generalized anxiety, depression, and OCD, this ending has me shaken to the core. Agh. "
You and your brain might want to talk some things out
Such amazing writing from such an awful username. I love Reddit. 
"&gt; As someone who also suffers from generalized anxiety, depression, and OCD

I ugh... I am really curious as to how your average day goes."
"&gt; I got mad at my roommate'a stupid cat and threw it off the roof

   WHY'D YOU DO THAT?!"
Typical high school lesbians.
"Well first I wake up and take my moodecine. I can't put on my glasses until after I've taken it. That's not OCD, it's just that the inability to see reminds me that I haven't taken it yet.   
I check email. I check my email about 35 times each day, in case someone is trying to get ahold of me and I offend them by taking too long to respond. This is partly my fault because I mostly insist on communicating via writing. Don't call me. I probably won't pick up. I'm afraid that if I can't understand someone over the phone I'll have to keep going ""what? what? what?"" and they will be annoyed with me. When people try to talk to me while I'm on the phone with someone else I get overwhelmed to an almost violent degree because they are making me not understand.           
When I wake up I have a general 'day plan' of what I want to accomplish. I need 24+ hours notice if I'm going to be invited to a social function. Otherwise it interferes with my day plan and that makes me really really uncomfortable.     
Anxiety is pretty general and I have ways of working around it. I tend to skin-pick so I have bandaids *everywhere* so I can wrap up a hangnail at a moment's notice. I also have tweezers everywhere because otherwise I'll pick errant hairs, too. My hands cannot be sticky, because then everything they touch is sticky, and soon everything will be sticky, and I will have no way to clean everything. So I have a lot of hand sanitizer and wet wipes and napkins, too. I pretty much bring a bubble of personal care products with me everywhere I go.      
Before I leave the house I need a roster of everywhere I am going and what I am going to do there. I get everything I need and put it in the car. If I'm going to have to interact with a person, I rehearse what I am going to say. I do research so that I know roughly what I'm looking for and what it will cost. Otherwise I feel like I offend shop clerks by going into their store and then rejecting their products as being too expensive. When I get to the register I have everything I need in-hand so I don't waste people's time. I rarely pay with cash, never count out exact change, and I never, ever, ever, pay by check. I must never be irritating.     

Anxiety is predictable and constant. Depression can strike at any time, like a sudden hail storm. When it happens, it's happening and there's nothing to be done. Batten down the hatches and hope it passes soon. Nothing's getting done until that happens. When it hits, you think of whatever you were going to do next and it suddenly seems boring and not worth doing. You try to think of something you'd rather do, but you can't. Every possible activity seems as appealing as cleaning the litter box. This can last anywhere from fifteen minutes to.... well, months. "

The man trembled, but spoke for us. ""Sir, I've been locked up at gunpoint, given endless scans, sent into supernatural darkness, seen my squadmates torn apart and then delivered back to me, put up with endless evil sermons, even shot a friend because a mosquito got in his brain. I'm *tiredâ€¦* and I know if I go back in the Ink, I'm gonna die.""

The brigadier general nodded, his gaze scanning the tired faces around him. ""You all feel this way?""

Nods followed.

He stepped back, and his already deep voice lowered an octave with grim anger. ""If we don't deal with this situation, we are all going to die. That means that you will probably die whether you go back into the Ink or not.""

Unhappy murmurs circled the crowd.

As he walked away, his order cut right into our hopes. ""Have them build hotboxes, and put them all through in a rotation until they comply. Two hours each.""

A great unhappy noise swelled among us, but we were soldiers, and we weren't going back into the Ink for the momentâ€¦ so we followed the officers' orders, and began building our own torture devices under the hot Sun.

I was already sweaty and tired when they threw me in the one I'd built.

It was simple, really - six metal plates bolted together. It hadn't even taken very long to make.

But my two hours would feel like forever.

I sat in there, sweating, frying, meltingâ€¦ for an eternity. All I wanted was to go home. This was a nightmare in every sense. Down one path, there was darkness and hellish threats that continually tore at us, at our sanityâ€¦ down the other, slowly dying in a hotbox.

The Sword wasn't going to let us leave.

It occurred to me, in a flash of feverish inspiration, that nobody had taken brain scans of the brigadier general himself. How did we know *he* wasn't under some evil influence?

What if a neural mosquito had gotten to *him*, and this was its way of slowly killing all of us?

I cried, but no tears came out. I was too dehydrated.

I remember being very certain that I was going to die in that box before I ever got a chance to grab for that one slim hopeâ€¦

But the top did eventually open, and they pulled me out and dumped the next guy in.

I stumbled to the nearest water and guzzled it down alongside a long line of other red-skinned soldiers doing the same.

As soon as I could, I slipped away, and found Thompson. She was in the techie tent, drawing plans to kill the Preacher. Her face wasâ€¦ absolutely filled with hate for that thingâ€¦ and I couldn't blame herâ€¦ but she quickly threw on a neutral expression when she saw me.

It was all I could do just to talk through my heat exhaustion. ""I have a theory that the brigadier general's been compromised.""

She regarded me with a skeptical but open look. ""Oh?""

I nodded, and tried to breathe normally. ""This isâ€¦ crazyâ€¦ it's unlike any campaign I've ever been on. That man is driving us forward with torture, and he doesn't care if we die. Do you have any recent brain scans of him? Like you took on us?""

Her gaze went distant for a moment. ""Noâ€¦ I don't, actually.""

""Will you get one?"" I asked, desperate.

She nodded. ""You're thinking neural mosquito?""

""Yeah.""

""I'll manage it,"" she promised quietly. ""Now get out of here before someone sees you. Nobody can know about this conversation.""

I made it to my bunk and fell before my body completely gave outâ€¦ and they came for me a few minutes later, dragging me back to the hotbox for my next turn.

There were a great many people in those boxes, in the sand, in the heatâ€¦ crying.

We couldn't last. It simply wasn't possible.

Groans and shouts gave way, and we were all spared the hotboxes for agreeing to go back into the Ink the next day.

I lay in my empty tent, awake the entire night, hoping against hope that your ex-wife would come through before we had to go back into that dark and silent Hell.

She snuck in some time just before dawn, a brain scan document in hand.

""What'd you get?"" I asked, exuberant, even trying to sit up.

She shook her head and showed me. ""He's clean.""

""*What?*""

""Nothing wrong with his brain. No mosquitoes. Whatever's out in the Ink, it really must be worth all this suffering.""

I remember sobbing uncontrollably. ""No.""

""I'm sorry,"" she said, pouring some water across my reddened forehead. ""But we're all here for a reason. Everything he's done is technically legal."" She paused. ""Butâ€¦ if he gets worse, come to me. I'll make some calls.""

I could only screw up my face and nod.

And, then, a few hours later, it was time to gear up and go back out.

There was no chatter, no murmursâ€¦ no talk of any kind. Silent, broken, despairing, we went through the motions of setting up lights and guarding ourselves against unknown threats, but I was sure each of us simply expected to die in some new and horrible way.

It was on that day that we finally reached our objective.

I think we were six miles deep into the Ink at that point, and four miles straight down thanks to the impossible slope. I envisioned it as an immense unseen crater that existed only inside that valley of darknessâ€¦

And it was just sitting there at the center of the enormous crater, the slope stretching up and away on all sides.

""Any contact with the Preacher yet?"" the brigadier general asked over the static-filled radio relays.

Nobody responded in the affirmative. They wouldn't, because I knew where the Preacher had gone. It had continually retreated whenever we'd tried to attack itâ€¦ and it had vacuumed up more than one of our dead colleagues to add to its bulk. Standing with five other men and staring at the source of the Ink, I knew where it had gone each night.

The ten-foot-high sphere sat casually in the sand, like it had simply chosen to fall and rest there. Each edge held an asymptotic darkness, but, within, we saw another place.

As we watched, it shifted.

Another placeâ€¦ and anotherâ€¦ seconds later, anotherâ€¦

This was some sort of hellish egg, or black hole, or shadow portal, or *something*â€¦ and it went to places beyond any of our worst fears.

We reported our discovery, and the next order did not surprise us at all.

""All units, gather at the Sphere. We'll deploy each time the blood-lakes and corpse-mountains world appears.""

This time, I knew who spoke. It was me. I picked up my radio, and signed what felt like my own death warrant: ""No, sir.""

""Do it.""

Another man raised his radio, his gaze aghast as he witnessed what looked like, in all actuality, Hell itself. His words were as tear-filled as his eyes. ""No, sir. We refuse.""

""*The Preacher must die!*"" the Sword roared over the radio, his high shout causing a burst of static.

Forty men and women now stood outside the Sphere, lit by a weird shadow-light that ignored the ten foot limit, and we looked at each other in confusion. The Preacher? Was that the true objective of our operations? Judging from the anger and hate in that shout, was this some sort ofâ€¦ revenge mission? Or had he simply lost it completely?

""Set your charges,"" I remember breathing, and, somehow, everyone heard me. I wasn't in charge, but they listened.

We piled up all the C4 and other explosives we had. We took all our mortar shells and rigged them up. We surrounded that fucking thing with enough firepower to blow a hole in reality itself. Fitting, judging by what I guessed that it was.

We trekked back through the Ink, unafraid now. Everything that had been in here had been coldly and carefully murdered by thousands of armed men and women, and there was nothing left but us. We'd never figured out who had been leaving our friends' limbs for us to find, but we guessed that, since they hadn't attacked us yet, they never would.

Long lines of soldiers trekked out of the Ink together, and we headed back to camp, soul-weary.

The Sword was standing there, waiting for us, all of the officers lined up to his left and right. His monolithic stance and grim expression indicated immediately that we were in trouble.

Somebody explained what we'd done, and that we'd set a timer on the explosives.

He took a breath, and somehow grew even taller. ""Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives.""

""There's hardly time,"" someone said.

""Reed,"" the Sword ordered, not so much as moving his head. ""Shoot that man in the leg.""

---

(continued in one more comment)"
"(continued from above)

---
The officer to his left lifted his firearm and -

The shot rang out, startling our entire crowd of exhausted soldiers.

The brigadier general spoke again. ""Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives. You have *no idea* what's at stake here.""

""Because you haven't told us!"" a woman to my right yelled. ""You have us out here on some revenge quest -""

""Hughes, shoot that woman.""

Another shot rang out, and she fell to the sand, bleeding.

""I will not hesitate,"" the Sword continued, his eyes fierce. ""Goâ€¦ disarmâ€¦ the explosives.""

None of us wanted to speak up after that. Slowly, our resolve failed, and - followed closely by officers with guns - we headed back into the Ink, found the Sphere, and disarmed the fireworks.

Many were sobbing uncontrollably as we did so, and many more were trying not to look at the nightmarish worlds within that ungodly Sphere.

He didn't even have us set up an ambush - he wanted the Preacher to come out, thinking it was safe to stalk us once more. It would never come back if we had the Sphere surroundedâ€¦

I lay in my tent that night running plans in my head. There was no way to walk to safety - the desert was filled with rebels that would shoot us on sight. And why wouldn't they? We'd taken their way of life, and all of their economic resources. It was what we had always done out here, more or less, at least until this nightmare had begun.

There was nowhere to go, and there was no escape.

I remember staring up at the empty bunks in my tent, realizing it nearly aloud.

The Sword had to die.

I felt like a ghost. I floated up from my bunk, and I drifted between the tents, whispering the words that would most certainly get *somebody* killed. Us, if we were found out - him, if we were not.

Perhaps *I* was insane by that point. I'd been hit by a giant mirrored tentacle, subjected to weeks of mental torture, thrown in a hotbox as physical torture, and cornered like an animal in every way possible. By then, I didn't even care if I survived.

The Sword had to die.

She was going around asking details about the Sphere when she heard what I was planning. I liked her, I did, and she seemed like a fine person, butâ€¦ we would all die if the Sword found out. She was already on her wayâ€¦ to tell him, I was sure.

I came at her from behind with a knife, trying to stay quiet, but she somehow heard my approach, and swung out of the way of the first strike. She was a hell of a fighter, and I was caught off guard. She knocked the knife from my hand, and I barely managed to leap toward it in the sand and prevent her from getting it. We struggled there, until one of my fellow mutineers came at her and knocked her away.

She shot right back up, got the knife, and slashed his arm deeply. He fell back, biting his lip to keep from screaming and giving us away.

A woman - one of ours - leapt in from around the edge of a tent, but Thompson straight up stabbed her in the shoulder despite my grip on her other arm.

Two more men came to assist, even as Thompson came around and viciously bit me in the neck. She took out a chunk, barely missing a vital artery or my throat, and I was forced to let her go. While I was gripping my neck, she ducked under one man's kick, responded with a punch between his legs, and came back up to stab the other man in the chest.

The knife got stuck, and she spent one second too long trying to get it out.

I shot her in the back.

The shot rang out, and shouts responded from nearby, even as my furious comrades surrounded her, kicking and stabbing her repeatedly out of animalistic revenge. She didn't make a sound, and I was glad: it meant she'd died from the initial shot, and hadn't felt the brutal beating that followed. She wasn't a bad person, she'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

There was no more time to delay, really. I pulled them off of her, and we ran as a group for the brigadier general's tentâ€¦ but it was too late.

They gunned most of the others down, and I fled.

I ran off into the desert, still bleeding from my neck, weak from everything else that had happenedâ€¦ and rebels found me. For some reason, they let me live, and they even helped me get better. I -

---

I looked up from the book.

Vasiliev Blaku stood at the other end of his cell, watching me back. A large scar on his neck still indicated the place Cristina had bit him.

The place she'd bit himâ€¦ just before he'd shot her. Just before they'd beaten her lifeless body to a pulp.

But she'd certainly taken to heart the personal defense training I'd given her. Was there some other sequence of events in which she might have survived? Just a second's differenceâ€¦

But I wasn't angry. The cold fury that had burned all through me to get me to this point was simply gone. I'd come here to kill this manâ€¦ but now I just felt drained.

Cristina's story was over.

I'd found out all the last details of her life, all the mysteries, andâ€¦ that was it. Vasiliev had been a wounded animal, and he'd been cornered by the brigadier general. He'd suffered in a way no man should have had to suffer.

Who was to blame? Who could be brought to justice for any of this, except the Sword himself?

Blaku could see the emotions in my eyes change rapidly. He trembled and sighed with relief as he saw my murderous intent fade. ""You're not gonna kill me, are you?""

I shook my head. ""No. I think that would cost me more than I'm willing to give."" I sighed with relief myself. ""But I do think we're honor-bound to be soldiers one last time together.""

He knew my meaning already. ""The Sword is one of these hallways, one of these cells.""

""Yes."" I stepped back, letting him out. ""Yes, he is."" I hefted the book. ""And thisâ€¦ this finds out the truth. Will you come with me and find out the truth of all this? And, if he is indeed the terrible man you knewâ€¦ if he brought the Crushing Fist upon usâ€¦""

""Yes. I'm going to finish what I started back then, in the desert."" He stepped forward. ""No trial for that monster. I'm gonna kill him myself.""

I walked with him, feeling much like the ghost he'd described himself as before doing something terrible. The First World had given up, the outer Shield was failing, nobody gave a shit about anything anymore, a half-trillion people were going to start starving in two months, and everyone was going to die.

It seemed the only thing left to do was tie up loose ends - mete out justice for those who deserved a fate worse than simply dying with the rest of humanity at whatever random moment the Shield failed. The book would get the truth, and we would finally knowâ€¦

You met this guy online, completely at random. The likelihood he's in your country, let alone will be there tomorrow is slim. He may very well know who you are, it doesn't sound like your ability to disguise yourself on the web is very good, but that's why he feels comfortable doing this. 

I've spent a lot of time on the dark net, and have been subject to similar things. I used to get calls with a woman screaming in the background and someone telling me that I would be murdered the following day. This went on for weeks, and now I am posting about it on reddit, so obviously it was fake. 

The dark net hosts some very bored, and very demented individuals. They also usually have a skill, like hacking, that generates money. It's rare anything serious is done via dark net for free. Everything costs something, that's why these guys aren't waving the Anonymous flag. They have a business to protect. So I seriously doubt, unless you've done something atrocious to your ex, that a computer guy from the dark net would travel to you, and then proceed to assault you. There's no money in it, it's highly risky, and he's probably never actually been in a fight. It's just fun to scare people. I would be more worried about him working to gain access to your accounts under the guise of hacking your ex. Just remember that people who break the law online, rarely want to add real world issues to their lives and often use this as a way to socialize. I would reply with a similar message saying ""bring it Bitch"". He'd probably laugh and this would be a thing going back and forth for a while until one of you got bored. "

The platoon leader told them to calm the fuck down, and do not fire, minutes went by. The wind dies down, and the figure disspears.

If you choose to stay in your home, close all the blinds and hide them in places around you house and make sure you keep something on you to protect yourself with at all times.

Check your house for surveillance equipment. You may have had this stalker for awhile, or it could be a creepy landlord.

You also need to get your computer looked at, or back up the shit you need and wipe that thing."
That last sentence made me cringe
Wait...so you have a possessed talking dog with multi personality disorder? Jesus OP...
"One time I got one of those apps because my girlfriend said I say funny things in my sleep. In the morning when I was listening to it, all I heard were so many farts I had to double check the bed sheets to make sure I didn't sleep shart"
"""Honey, I'm pretty sure you farted all last night""

""Uh..."" *deletes incriminating recording* ""no I didn't..."" "
I don't think you'll ever fully understand how much I needed to read something like this. Thank you. 
"Jaysus Christe I feel ill.. The descriptions were disturbingly intense. The best revenge would be with a gargantuan magnifying glass. 
"
Brilliant. This is the type of shit R.L. Stine lives for.
I really shouldn't have read this after seeing the title. I literally have a diagnosed phobia of bugs.
Why didn't they just walk outside... 
Anyone else itchy after reading that? I feel itchy as hell.
"This comment gives me the impression that you are R.L. Stine speaking in the third person.

Edit: typeo"
BUGGIES
"Yeah, that sounds like a bad plan. "
Please write parts three and four before he kills you.
I really enjoy the idea that exterminators are like these ancient guardians holding the secrets of the horrors of the Ant Empire that the general public must never be allowed to know.
These are the things that make me want to become an entomologist.
"That makes me laugh. ""R.L. Stine only speaks in the III, baby!"""
"If you come across my mp3 player while you're rummaging through my shit, could you please put it somewhere obvious? I've been looking for that goddamn thing for a week now!"

"When i was 15 i suffered extreme depression, so much so that i could never even envision happiness of any kind in my future. I went to a local bridge to end it all. I had thought deeply about how to end myself and decided on the bridge for two reason. One: i would probably die instantly from hitting the rocks in the river. Two: even if i didnt die from the rocks i was an extremely weak swimmer and knew that even if i survived i could never swim to shore. I was right. I drowned and was dead almost 4 minutes. A stranger driving by saw me jump, stopped his truck, and dove in after me. He swam with me to shore and performed CPR on me. Now, as i look into the beautiful smiling face of my son, almost a decade from that date, i am experiencing such love and joy that i never felt possible until i had had him.Every day i feel such joy and am so grateful for the man who saved me and gave me the chance to find such happiness. And so that i always remember what i almost stole from myself i named my son after the one who gave it back to me. "
"Oh man, I thought only my family talked about stick indians. Awesome story! "
"For some clarity: Isak knows everyone because he looks like multiple people. He's taken their bits and made them him. He needs social interaction or else he cannot function and part of that is he has the power to attract everyone to him. Yeah?
I love the hell out of this, btw."
"Sometimes the ""monsters"" aren't monsters.  "
"Was rooting for the stick Indian the whole time

#teamstickindian"
"Do you think the Stick Indians may not attack you, depending on what tribe you are from? "
Stick Indians - Defenders of non-Stick Indians everywhere.
This is my new motto for life. 
And how glad I am for that
"I'm not sure, to be perfectly honest. It could very well be that, but it was my knowledge that they committed acts of cannibalism non-descriminately. However, I just don't know anymore."
"Honestly, I don't know. I would like to believe it's defending me, that the whistling is what drew him. The whistling is what attracts the attention of them, but I don't know if he only attacked Caleb because he was hungry or because he was hurting me. Maybe both? I'm still unsure as to why he didn't eat me too. "

"Don't worry guys, I googled it. The dude is just really passionate about laundry.

&gt;A triangle with lines through it means that you should only use non-chlorine bleach when needed. A black triangle with an X through it means that you should not use bleach on this item. A circle in a square is the symbol for tumble dry."
I pictured the main character as Paul Blart Mall Cop the whole time I read this
Halfway through I thought this was some dig at Sunday School in general. Then we got to the end of it. I don't want to know what the hell went on in there.
"""I can make you pure!....*with Persil non-bio*"""
Sunday school was a bad place in the town. Father Cohen was hurting the children and possibly raping or molesting them. It was so bad that only 3 people of her graduating class survived. That's what I took from the story. 
"Oh my. I'm so very sorry about your brother, OP. Please don't do anything rash, Will's family is likely very innocent in all of this."
I actually really enjoyed this read. So sorry about your father and sister. Please stay safe OP
Anyone else instantly go over there?
This reminds me of Jonestown. These cults are so horrifically sad... 
Didnt even read the story.
This is a great marketing campaign for /r/DimensionalJumping
Hey man you must be new to this sub people sometimes pretend the stories are real in the comments just to add a little roleplay to the whole story telling experience.
TIL! Sorry guys the asshole in me jumped to life 
"A wise man once said,

&gt;""We are all part asshole. What separates the good from bad are apologies."""
"No, do it op, remember what he took from you"
"Fall asleep on the couch.

Get carried to bed.

????

Profit."
Omg im soooo glad you didn't hurt that poor innocent kid. And honestly taking him from will is punishment. He took your brother and you took his but you did a good thing. 
"New TLC special, ""19 Demons and counting""

"My body is not ready.

...But I don't think yours was either."
"The lack of cervix, vagina and vulva should not be a problem for giving birth - caesarian is not that huge of a surgery. A much bigger worry in my opinion is how exactly that ""foetus"" or whatever it is is feeding on your insides. It's ""consuming"" your fat tissue? But that is not how things are supposed to work, a foetus needs a whole lot more than that to survive and grow properly. Who knows what damage it is doing to you.

And how the hell did people get wind of this, like those protesters? Did the doctors break the privacy codes? That is not okay either, that is messed up. 

And lastly, another good question or worry would be: how the hell did it get there in the first place? Is it even human? Is it alien? Have you been abducted by aliens and had it put into you? Like... what the heck... I have nothing.
"
"Could it be a missing twin somehow finally getting nutrients to grow?

A missing twin is a twin that got consumed by its larger twin while developing.  they show up later in life as bits of tissue found in cysts and tumors in their twin's body.  Maybe this one somehow became viable?"
"Not that huge of a surgery? 

I'm guessing you've never had a C-section. Just because most women are able to be conscious for one doesn't mean it isn't a big surgery. It may not be a heart transplant, but it is certainly a big surgery with a long list of possible complications and potential for things to go wrong. 

And the recovery period is hell. 

Source: I've had one. "
I think your comment is more fucked up than the story.

Am I the only one who reads these stories and when I see an animal is in it I just really hope that the animal is ok...? Hope you are ok to OP but.. animals. Feelings. Woo!
"Hmm, it seems as if the lady on the staff is one of the lunatics that want this child to be born, despite what it is doing to Evan. I wish all the best, please keep us updated the best that you can
"
PLEASE UPDATE. omg this is one of the strangest and most intriguing stories on here!! 
"Please for the love of God, stop saying 'the internets'"
"In regards to your last sentence... What the fuck man? Have you been reading about how the parasite-baby is feeding off of Evan and how his body wants to get rid of the monster, or not?"
"As someone who frequents nosleep and the internet in general a lot, this was the most disturbing part of the story."
"Maybe it's an inside joke he has with his friend OP, and every time he writes it he smirks and thinks back to a time before this Hellish situation...if only for a second.."
"I have, it was called Breaking Dawn."
Silence Will Fall...
"Orange peels? You don't think it could be....no,  no way fuck that I'm outta here."
I couldn't get past the other room was for her cat.
